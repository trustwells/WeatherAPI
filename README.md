This is a simple full stack site utilizing NodeJS, ExpressJS, Axios for API communication, and EJS. This specific site connects to a public API that will return weather stats for the specific locaiton.


First, I had to convert the location to latitude and longitude coordinates. After converting, I'm able to send those coordinates to the API again to retrieve the temperature for that location.
